# Panopto Video Upload Process

## Overview
This document outlines key information about the process of uploading videos to Panopto using the Panopto REST API. While this isn't a comprehensive guide, it highlights the steps involved in creating a session, performing a multipart upload of the video file, creating the manifest, and finalising the upload. This serves as an informational resource for implementing the video upload functionality in the future. Additional research and context will be needed to fully integrate these steps.

---

## Step 1: Create a Session for Video Upload

Before uploading a video, a session must be created. The session provides the necessary details for the upload process, including the upload target and session ID.

###  Call the Session Creation API
The session creation process is triggered by sending a POST request to the `sessionUpload` endpoint.

- **API Endpoint:**
  ```ruby
  POST https://{server}/Panopto/PublicAPI/REST/sessionUpload
  ```
- **Payload:**
  ```http
  {
    "FolderId": "{folder_id}"
  }

  ```
- **Example Session Creation:**
  ```ruby
  response = RestClient.post(
    "https://#{server}/Panopto/PublicAPI/REST/sessionUpload",
    { "FolderId" => folder_id }.to_json,
    { content_type: :json, accept: :json, authorization: "Bearer #{access_token}" }
  )
  ```

- **Example Response:**
  ```http
  {
    "ID": "session_id",
    "UploadTarget": "upload_target_url",
    "FolderId": "{folder_id}"
  }
  ```
## Step 2: Upload Video via Multipart Upload
Panopto supports multipart uploads for large video files. This step uploads the video in parts to the upload target specified in the session creation response.

#### 1. Initiate Multipart Upload:
- Get the Upload URL: After creating a session, extract the UploadTarget URL from the session creation response. This URL specifies where the video should be uploaded.

- Set Up AWS SDK (boto3): Even though Panopto doesnâ€™t require AWS credentials, we use AWS SDK to handle the multipart upload. Initialise the SDK with dummy credentials (to bypass authentication but still use the multipart upload logic).

```ruby
# Extract the Upload Target URL from the session creation response
upload_target = "https://deakin.au.panopto.com/Panopto/Upload/..."

# Set up AWS SDK for multipart upload
s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new(
  endpoint: upload_target,
  region: 'us-east-1',
  access_key_id: 'dummy',
  secret_access_key: 'dummy'
)

# Initiate multipart upload
mpu = s3.create_multipart_upload(Bucket: 'upload-bucket', Key: 'video-file.mp4')
upload_id = mpu['UploadId']
```
### 2. Upload Parts:
- Split the Video File: Split the video into parts, each no larger than 5MB. You can adjust the part size as needed.

- Upload Each Part: Iterate over the parts and upload them using the AWS SDK. Track the ETag for each part.

```ruby
# Read the video file in 5MB chunks and upload parts
File.open('video_path.mp4', 'rb') do |file|
  part_number = 1
  while (chunk = file.read(5 * 1024 * 1024))  # 5MB per part
    s3.upload_part(
      bucket: 'upload-bucket',
      key: 'test-video.mp4',
      part_number: part_number,
      upload_id: upload_id,
      body: chunk
    )
    part_number += 1
  end
end
```
### 3. Complete Multipart Upload:
- Finalise the Upload: Once all parts have been uploaded, call the complete_multipart_upload method to combine the parts into one video file in Panopto.

```ruby
# After all parts have been uploaded, complete the upload
s3.complete_multipart_upload(
  bucket: 'upload-bucket',
  key: 'video-file.mp4',
  upload_id: upload_id,
  multipart_upload: { parts: parts_metadata }  # Metadata about each uploaded part
)
```
## Step 3: Create and Upload the Manifest File
Once the video is uploaded, the next step is to create the manifest file. The manifest provides metadata for the video, including its title, description, and the file name.

### 1. Create the Manifest File:
- The manifest file is an XML file that contains the following key elements:

```xml
Copy code
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Session xmlns="http://tempuri.org/UniversalCaptureSpecification/v1">
  <Title>{Video_Title}</Title>
  <Description>{Video_Description}</Description>
  <Date>{Current_Date}</Date>
  <Videos>
    <Video>
      <Start>PT0S</Start>
      <File>{Video_File_Name}</File>
      <Type>Primary</Type>
    </Video>
  </Videos>
</Session>
```
### 2. Upload the Manifest File:
- The manifest file is uploaded in the same way as the video parts, using multipart upload.
``` Example Upload (Using AWS SDK):
ruby

s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new(
  endpoint: upload_target,
  region: 'us-east-1',
  access_key_id: 'dummy',
  secret_access_key: 'dummy'
)

s3.put_object(bucket: bucket_name, key: manifest_key, body: File.read(manifest_file))
```
## Step 4: Finalise the Upload
After uploading the video and the manifest file, the final step is to finalise the session marking it as complete.

### 1. Send the PUT Request to Finalise Session:
API Endpoint:

```ruby
PUT https://{server}/Panopto/PublicAPI/REST/sessionUpload/{session_id}
```
Payload:

```ruby

{
  "State": 1,  # Mark as completed
  "FolderId": "{folder_id}"
}
```
Example Code:

```ruby
RestClient.put(
  "https://#{@server}/Panopto/PublicAPI/REST/sessionUpload/#{@session_id}",
  { "State" => 1, "FolderId" => @folder_id }.to_json,
  { content_type: :json, accept: :json, authorization: "Bearer #{@access_token}" }
)
```
## 2. Monitor the Upload Status:
- Check for Processing: After finalising, periodically check the session state to ensure it is processed and completed.

Polling Example:

```ruby

while true
  sleep(5)  # Wait a few seconds before checking  status
  session = RestClient.get("https://#{@server}/Panopto/PublicAPI/REST/sessionUpload/#{@session_id}")
  if JSON.parse(session.body)["State"] == 4  # State 4 means processing complete
    break
  end
end
```
