# Panopto Video Upload Process Guide

## Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide on how to upload videos to Panopto using the Panopto REST API. The process includes creating a session, uploading the video file using multipart upload, creating a manifest, and finalising the upload.

---

## Step 1: Create a Session for Video Upload

Before uploading a video, a session must be created. The session provides the necessary details for the upload process, including the upload target and session ID.

###  Call the Session Creation API
The session creation process is triggered by sending a POST request to the `sessionUpload` endpoint.

- **API Endpoint:**
  ```ruby
  POST https://{server}/Panopto/PublicAPI/REST/sessionUpload
  ```
- **Payload:**
  ```http
  {
    "FolderId": "{folder_id}"
  }

  ```
- **Example Session Creation:**
  ```ruby
  response = RestClient.post(
    "https://#{server}/Panopto/PublicAPI/REST/sessionUpload",
    { "FolderId" => folder_id }.to_json,
    { content_type: :json, accept: :json, authorization: "Bearer #{access_token}" }
  )
  ```

- **Example Response:**
  ```http
  {
    "ID": "session_id",
    "UploadTarget": "upload_target_url",
    "FolderId": "{folder_id}"
  }
  ```
## Step 2: Upload Video via Multipart Upload
Panopto supports multipart uploads for large video files. This step uploads the video in parts to the upload target specified in the session creation response.

#### 1. Initiate Multipart Upload:
- Get the Upload URL: After creating a session, extract the UploadTarget URL from the session creation response. This URL specifies where the video should be uploaded.

- Set Up AWS SDK (boto3): Even though Panopto doesnâ€™t require AWS credentials, we use AWS SDK to handle the multipart upload. Initialise the SDK with dummy credentials (to bypass authentication but still use the multipart upload logic).

Sample Code:

```ruby
# Extract the Upload Target URL from the session creation response
upload_target = "https://deakin.au.panopto.com/Panopto/Upload/..."

# Set up AWS SDK for multipart upload
s3 = Aws::S3::Client.new(
  endpoint: upload_target,
  region: 'us-east-1',
  access_key_id: 'dummy',
  secret_access_key: 'dummy'
)

# Initiate multipart upload
mpu = s3.create_multipart_upload(Bucket: 'upload-bucket', Key: 'video-file.mp4')
upload_id = mpu['UploadId']
```
### 2. Upload Parts:
Split the Video File: Split the video into parts, each no larger than 5MB. You can adjust the part size as needed.

Upload Each Part: Iterate over the parts and upload them using the AWS SDK. Track the ETag for each part.

Sample Code:

```ruby
# Read the video file in 5MB chunks and upload parts
File.open('video_path.mp4', 'rb') do |file|
  part_number = 1
  while (chunk = file.read(5 * 1024 * 1024))  # 5MB per part
    s3.upload_part(
      bucket: 'upload-bucket',
      key: 'test-video.mp4',
      part_number: part_number,
      upload_id: upload_id,
      body: chunk
    )
    part_number += 1
  end
end
```
### 3. Complete Multipart Upload:
- Finalise the Upload: Once all parts have been uploaded, call the complete_multipart_upload method to combine the parts into one video file in Panopto.
Sample Code:

```ruby
# After all parts have been uploaded, complete the upload
s3.complete_multipart_upload(
  bucket: 'upload-bucket',
  key: 'video-file.mp4',
  upload_id: upload_id,
  multipart_upload: { parts: parts_metadata }  # Metadata about each uploaded part
)
```
