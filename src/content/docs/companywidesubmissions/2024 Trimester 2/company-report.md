# Company Structure

![Org chart](/company-structure/2024-t2-thoth-tech-structure.png)

# Project 1: OnTrack

## Project Overview

**_Give an overview or ‘executive summary’ of the project, including any necessary high-level
information for someone reading about your work for the first time. The following questions should
help guide your thinking._**

**_What is the project about?_**

**_What problem is the project solve?_**

**_What are the aims of the project?_**

**_What are the deliverables?_**

## User Manual

**_Give instructions for how someone should use your product or navigate around your development
environment. Include images, diagrams, or anything that would help a first-time user to use your
product correctly._**

**_Better yet, you could create short instructional videos using software like
[Loom](https://www.loom.com/) and include the video links in this section. You may find this option
is considerably easier than trying to communicate your instructions through text! (Note: this is
just a suggestion, it’s not mandatory.) Here are some ideas of what to cover:_**

**_If your product currently requires a complex set of steps to activate, include that._**

**_If your product has a hardware component, explain how to activate and sync the hardware with the
software._**

**_If your team has a user experience journey that they’ve mapped out for when a user navigates your
product, run through a demo of that._**

## Completed Deliverables

**_Provide a list of product features and/or deliverables, including a brief description, that have
been completed this trimester. Please relate these deliverables to their corresponding Trello cards
if this is possible._**

**_Only include features and/or deliverables that are fully complete – incomplete work is to be
listed in section 4. Roadmap._**

**_Make sure to explicitly highlight which features and/or deliverables where completed this
Trimester and which team member(s) were primarily responsible for their completion._**

**_Also, please indicate where each of the completed deliverables can be found (E.g., MS Teams,
GitHub repository) and make sure to include a URL link to the resource._**

## Roadmap

**_Provide a list of features and/or deliverables that are planned to be completed in the project’s
future (E.g., next trimester or two trimesters in the future)._**

**_Please also include features and/or deliverables that are in progress but not yet complete. The
state of each incomplete work item should be briefly described._**

**_This section should pair up perfectly with your Roadmap on Trello. Make sure both this section
and your Trello Roadmap are updated upon handing over the project._**

## Open Issues

**_List all of the issues and challenges that the team is still facing, and any progress that has
been made so far to address them._**

**_The purpose of this section is to flag things that may interfere with the future teams’s ability
to work on the project, and to give advice as to how these issues could be fixed in future._**

**_Here are some examples of Open Issues:_**

- **_Software compatibility issues that arise when members of the team use different version of
  software._**

- **_An unclear process for reviewing completed tasks on Trello, leading to a backlog of work that
  is sitting somewhere between unfinished and finished._**

- **_An essential team member had to leave the team with no notice, and there is currently a skill
  void in their place._**

## Lessons Learned

**_List key lessons learned from the project this Trimester and what you recommend future teams
should do differently. You must also explain why you believe this to be the case._**

**_In particular, try to think about processes or technology that you would recommend be changed in
the future; things that an uniformed team may mistake for a good idea at first, but later learn to
be ineffective._**

**_For example, maybe your team had challenges communicating their progress during panel
presentations, but towards the end of the Trimester, you developed an effective method for conveying
progress accurately. This would be a great thing to talk about._**

## Product Development Life Cycle

**_This section should explain how your team undertakes work. It is an attempt to codify your
processes so that they can be understood and followed by new members._**

**_As a team, you may not have clearly defined your Product Development Life Cycle, and that’s okay!
This is an excellent opportunity to explain the work methods, processes and habits that your team
has been developing intuitively over the course of the Trimester._**

### New Tasks

**_How are new tasks created?_**

**_How does your team form new ideas about work that needs to be done and turn those ideas into
distinct, actionable tasks?_**

**_For example, maybe your team meets at the start of each week, reviews your progress in your
current sprint, makes a big long list of everything to be done, and then converts that list into a
series of cards on Trello. This process would be something you talk about in this section._**

### Definition of Done

**_How does the team know when a task is done?_**

**_What are criteria for a successfully completed task?_**

**_This may seem obvious, but it in a software development project having a definition of done can
ensure a certain standard of work that holds all team members accountable. For example, messy,
clunky code that “just works” is very different to clean, well-commented code that works AND is easy
to understand. Which would you prefer to be your team’s definition of done?_**

### Task Review

**_Who reviews a task once it’s been marked as done?_**

**_How does the team ensure that all work is looked over before it’s contributed to the main
repository or working prototype?_**

**_If you don’t currently have a system for reviewing tasks, make sure to flag this for next
trimester’s team to work on as soon as they begin._**

### Testing

**_How do you test your product to see if it does what it was originally planned to do?_**

**_If your product isn’t heavily comprised of software, how can you build in testing to your team’s
product development life cycle to ensure that “stuff works as it should”?_**

### Branching Strategy

**_How does your team currently use GitHub repository?_**

**_What rules for commits and pull-requests have been put in place so far?_**

**_How should new members use GitHub repository in a way that doesn’t result in all commits being
dumped in a messy Master branch?_**

**_Again, if your team hasn’t formally discussed a branching strategy, this a great opportunity to
describe what your current system is and how it could be improved going forward._**

**_For example, if you currently have all members of the team commit directly to the Master branch,
can you recommend any tutorials for the future team to review that might lead to a cleaner, more
organised and more efficient repository?_**

## Product Architecture

### UML Diagram

**_Provide a high-level map of the project showing all of its components and how they relate to each
other._**

**_An example of this is a UML diagram. Don’t feel that you need to follow any particular UML
paradigm, so long as your diagram is informative and easy to read._**

**_Resources like [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) and [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)
are incredibly useful for this._**

### Tech Stack

**_List all of the software and hardware utilised in this project. For each tool, give a short
description and explain why it was chosen._**

## Source Code

**_All source code should be found on your team’s GitHub repository, unless your project has unique
constraints that require you to store your code elsewhere. This includes any resources (e.g.,
wireframes, designs) that need to be transferred over to the new team as well._**

**_Please provide all of the necessary instructions to accessing your source code. This includes
URLs of online hosted repositories, links to any software dependencies, database components, or
external libraries._**

**_If your code is hosted on a server external to Deakin, make sure to also transfer digital copies
of your code over to your client and the next team as a backup._**

## Login Credentials

**_Please provide all credentials (usernames and passwords) for any of the resources, websites, or
platforms being utilised for this project. Please make sure that none of these credentials share
passwords or usernames with any of your team’s private credentials._**

## Other Relevant Information

**_This section is an invitation to add any additional information that you think will help to
onboard new members. If you choose not to add any extra sections to this document, this section
should be deleted._**

**_Please edit this entire document as you see fit. If you think adding 5 extra sections that aren’t
listed here will help to communicate the nuances of your project to future members, go ahead! We
want you to take full ownership of your handover and this document._**

## Appendices

**_Include all relevant artefacts delivered during the course of the project. Anything that will
paint a clearer picture of your team’s progress this trimester, the things that informed decisions,
and the evolution of your product._**

**_Please also include a link to your team’s showcase video._**

# Project 3: SplashKit

## Product Development Life Cycle

### New Tasks

In SplashKit it is up to individuals to assign themselves to cards – generally speaking, it is fine
to assign oneself to any card unless otherwise noted. New cards are created by discussing the
problem with mentors, either during stand-ups or directly – if approved, the mentor will create the
card and you can assign yourself to it.

### Definition of Done

A task is only considered fully done once it has been completed, submitted as a pull request, and
reviewed by two other students who approve it (see below). Once a mentor reviews it, it may be
considered fully complete, or potentially moved back to doing if unsatisfactory.

### Task Review

Two mandatory peer reviews must be completed before the mentor review. Once the pull request is
made, contact a teammate for a review and upon agreement, tag this teammate under the Teams Planner
card and GitHub pull request as the reviewer. Make sure to review and test the code syntax, logic,
and output through pulling the changes unto your local machine if you are the reviewer. If the
reviewer requests any changes, update the contribution, and notify the reviewer. Once the changes
are committed and pushed, it will automatically update the pull request; thus, there is no need to
make another pull request.
[Watch this tutorial video by Satika Jayawardena](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/sites/ThothTech2/Shared%20Documents/OnTrack/Demo%20videos/pull-request-demo.mov?csf=1&web=1&e=a6p1gg&nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJTdHJlYW1XZWJBcHAiLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJTaGFyZURpYWxvZy1MaW5rIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXcifX0%3D)
from the OnTrack team on creating and reviewing someone else’s pull request.

Once the peer review is complete and your contribution was deemed correct by your teammate, the pull
request may be moved into the Mentor Review column – in time, a mentor will review the work, and if
it is deemed satisfactory it will be considered complete and moved into the current sprint’s
Complete column.

### Testing

Testing strategies depend on the project – please see each project’s onboarding information for more
details.

### Branching Strategy

Refer to the Branch Prefixes and Commit Message Format sections of the
[Git Contributions Guide](https://thoth-tech.netlify.app/resources/quality-assurance/git-contributions-guide/)
for guidelines on creating Git branches and commits for contributions.

## Product Architecture

### SplashKit.io Website

The SplashKit.io website is the primary portal for developers and learners, offering a modern,
responsive interface built with Starlight (Astro), React, SolidJS, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and
Docker. It provides users with access to API documentation, installation guides, and tutorials,
making it essential for anyone looking to learn or expand their knowledge of SplashKit. This website
supports external developers, especially beginners, in using SplashKit for 2D game development and
interactive applications.

### SplashKit SDK

The SplashKit SDK is a versatile toolkit designed to simplify 2D game development and interactive
application creation. It is primarily built using C++, SDL, and OpenGL, and is managed through CMake
and Clang/LLVM. The SDK supports cross-platform development on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry
Pi, allowing developers to create applications that run on multiple platforms using a single
codebase. Additionally, the SDK includes automated translation into C#, Python, and Pascal.

### SplashKit Online

SplashKit Online is a web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that enables users to
write, compile, and run SplashKit projects directly in their browsers. It supports JavaScript and
experimental C++ through WebAssembly (Wasm) via Emscripten. The platform uses Node/NPM for
dependency management and test server operation. SplashKit Online aims to make it easy for
developers, particularly beginners, to get started with SplashKit without needing to install any
software.

### Arcade Machine

The SplashKit-powered arcade machines, developed in collaboration with Deakin University, run on
Raspberry Pi using emulationstation and retropie. These machines allow students and developers to
upload and test games developed with SplashKit in a real-world arcade setting. The machines offer a
hands-on experience where games can be played and evaluated using physical arcade hardware.

### Game Development

The Game Development team produces games that showcase SplashKit's capabilities. These games are
typically built using C++ or C# and adhere to industry-standard game design practices. The games
serve as examples of what can be achieved using SplashKit, demonstrating various features of the
SDK, including graphics, input handling, and audio management.
